    bio: `We have all studied about molecules and reactions in Chemistry, and marveled at its wonders, but not many of us have actually thought as to how it touches our daily lives. One man dared to dream different, think different, and create an Indian enterprise, to cater to the Chemical and polymer needs of the world. An industry leader today, HPL Additives, is the result of a small step by its founding father, Mr. Harcharan Singh decades ago!

Born in Lyallpur (now Faislabad) in Pakistan, Mr. Harcharan Singh completed his education with Masters in Chemistry (honours) in 1960 from Punjab University. Thereafter, he worked with Sriram Institute of Industrial Research (SRIR) as a scientific officer for five years, where he was actively involved in research in the field of polymers and polymer additives.

Not content with the challenges offered to him at SRIR, he followed his dream to start an enterprise that would alter the image of the polymer additives industry of that time and in the years to come.

Mr. Singh started off in 1964, with low resources but big dreams, backed by his vision, zeal and entrepreneurial spirit to manufacture DPT, an import substitute for the first time in the country. He was alone, short on funds and business expertise, but had the grit & determination to chase his dreams, despite numerous challenges. It took him sometime, but soon with focus on quality and competitiveness, High Polymer Labs (as the company was known then), established itself as a reliable and high quality manufacturer in India.

He believed in setting up world standard manufacturing facilities replete with best technology as well as capacity. Today, the group boasts of 4 state-of-the-art plants throughout North India. He further laid emphasis on the need for stronger organisational values and right talent for sustained growth which forms HPL’s DNA today.

With him as the Chairman & Managing Director, the organisation’s focus has always been on ‘growth through technical excellence’. Quite early, he decided Innovation and R&D to be the core drivers of growth. That is precisely why, HPL has strongly focused on in-house R&D which is recognised by the Department of Science and Technology. Practically all our product lines have been researched in-house with no technology transfers agreements or collaborations from abroad.

In recognition of above, HPL Additives Ltd. received the National Award in the area of Allied and Chemicals by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India in 2003.

Mr. Singh’s constant desire for growth and expansion motivated the company to look beyond Indian shores, reach and tap the export markets. HPL’s products have presence in 45 countries as of today. Numerous awards won by HPL for research, technology development and exports are testimony of his vision.

Mr. Singh was actively involved with the PHD Chambers of Commerce, Indo American Chambers of Commerce, Indo German Chambers of Commerce, CII and FICCI.

He was also a keen sports enthusiast & avid golfer.

Apart from instilling sound values of CSR in the company, Mr. Singh was compassionate about social causes himself and set up a charitable trust, HPL Foundation to patronise various charities and NGOs related with health & education.

In recognition of his contribution to the industry, the Institute of Marketing and Management, in January 1995, bestowed the Top CEO Award on him.

In 2012, Faridabad Industries Association honored him with the Life Time Achievement Award.

In 2016, he was conferred with THE TYCOONS OF FARIDABAD award for his contribution to the industry and state during his illustrious career spanning over five decades by the leading Hindi newspaper chain of JAGRAN, and felicitated by the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Haryana.

In 2017, The Times group (The Economic Times, The Times of India and Navbharat Times, etc.) bestowed upon him, the honour of Icon of Haryana along with Dr. Naresh Trehan, Mr. Navin Jindal, Mr. Rajan Nanda & Mr. KC Lakhani and others.

Not the one to rest on his laurels, Mr. Singh kept exploring new domains to make HPL future-proof. He foresaw new challenges like rapid obsolescence in technology. He pushed the company to remain updated and competitive with absorption of latest technology.

Mr. Singh also understood that human aspirations have undergone a remarkable shift, driven by technology and education. He ensured that HPL remained a preferred choice of work by offering satisfying career opportunities and environment.

Mr. Singh firmly believed that with 50% of turnover from exports, HPL has the potential to become a world level player in the polymer additives domain. It only required scaling up in certain areas and creating wherewithal internally to meet the evolving new challenges.

Today, Mr. Harcharan Singh is no more with us to lead HPL Additives - a sapling he planted in 1964 and nurtured for 56 years, personally. He left for his heavenly abode on September 19, 2020.

He has left behind a company with strong foundation, a clear vision for growth and ingrained corporate values to carry forward his legacy. While Mr. Singh may not be around, but his spirit and advice will be the guiding light of HPL forever!`,
